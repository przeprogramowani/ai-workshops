Create a technical requirements document for a new fiche app feature.

Description of the fiche application:
<app_description>.
{{APP_DESCRIPTION}}
</app_description>.

Description of the new feature:
<app_new_feature>.
{{APP_NEW_FEATURE}}
</app_new_feature>.

The document should include:

1. feature description (2-3 sentences)
2. user stories (3-5 key stories in Gherkin format)
3. main user flows
4. UI/UX considerations
5. technical implementation details:

- Frontend requirements (I use X)
- Backend requirements (I use Y)
- API endpoints needed
- Database changes (I use DB and ORM)

6. Testing approach

Focus on the technical details rather than the business case. Be specific and practical.
