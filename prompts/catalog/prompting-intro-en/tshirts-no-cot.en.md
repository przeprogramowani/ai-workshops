Daniel, Emily, Marciano and Christina are wearing solid colored t-shirts. Their t-shirts are red, yellow, green and blue. Only the person wearing the blue t-shirt is telling the truth, while the other three are lying. They make the following statements: Daniel: "Marciano is wearing a red t-shirt". Emily: "Daniel is not wearing yellow". Marciano: "Emily is wearing blue". Christina: "Tomorrow I will wear blue". Can you determine the color of each person's t-shirt and can we expect Christina to wear blue tomorrow? Give a quick answer without breaking down the task step by step.
