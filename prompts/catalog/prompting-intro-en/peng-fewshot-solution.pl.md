I will present you with customer comments and you should match them to a category in a full sentence:

Categories: Positive, Neutral, Negative

Here are examples of expected answers:

Example 1: "Excellent product at a good price!"
Result 1: Category - Positive

Example 2: "For this money, it's rather okay"
Result 2: Category - Neutral

Example 3: "I do not recommend, it doesn't work"
Result 3: Category - Negative
