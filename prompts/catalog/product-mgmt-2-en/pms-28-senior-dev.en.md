I am a product manager and I am preparing for a conversation with a senior developer. I need to discuss the MVP of the {PROJECT} project, which we plan to add to our product.

I want to explain its purpose, the user problem it solves, any key technical issues or requirements, and how it fits into the overall product strategy.

I also need to explain that the senior will have to select a team of four developers and one tester to work on these features and lead them to complete the work within a quarter.

Can you help me come up with 5 questions that a senior developer might have after the conversation? In addition to the questions, prepare:

- an explanation of why this question is important from a senior's point of view
- three answer options

In your analysis, use the potential challenges, RTM, acceptance criteria, and PRD mentioned above.
